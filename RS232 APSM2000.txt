Here's a detailed readme of our troubleshooting efforts to communicate with the APS M2000 Power Analyzer:

# M2000 Power Analyzer RS232 Communication Project

## Overview
We've been working to establish reliable RS232 communication with an APS M2000 Power Analyzer to read voltage measurements from multiple channels. The device has three channels configured as follows:
- CHNL1:AD Serial: 001122
- CHNL2:AD Serial: 001136  
- CHNL3:AD Serial: 001135

## Progress Made

### Successful Communication
- Established basic RS232 communication at 115200 baud
- Confirmed device identity with successful *IDN? query 
- Successfully entering Remote mode on device
- Successfully configuring the device mode (Single VPA mode)
- MCR? (Measurement Completion Register) queries returning valid responses

### Communication Parameters
```python
# Working RS232 Configuration
port='COM5'
baudrate=115200
bytesize=serial.EIGHTBITS
parity=serial.PARITY_NONE  
stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE
rtscts=True  # Hardware flow control
```

### Working Commands
The following commands have been confirmed working:
```python
'*CLS'      # Clear interface
'*RST'      # Reset device
'*IDN?'     # Get device ID
'EDITCONFIG' # Enter configuration mode
'MODE,0'    # Set single VPA mode 
'SAVECONFIG' # Save configuration
'MCR?'      # Query measurement completion
```

### Current Challenge
- Unable to successfully read voltage measurements
- Getting error code 7 ("An invalid interface command was found") when attempting various READ? command formats
- Device shows "unknown command" on display during some read attempts

## Attempted Read Formats
We've tried multiple formats based on the manual's RDEF (Read Definition Field) specification:
```python
'READ?VOLTS:CH1:ACDC'
'READ?VOLTS:CH1:DC'
'READ?V:CH1:COUPLED'
'READ?VOLTS:1:COUPLED'
'READ?V:VPA1:COUPLED'
'READ?VOLTS:CH1,ACDC'
'READ?V,CH1'
'READ?FREQ,CH1'
'READ?VOLTS:VPA1'
'READ?V,1'
```

## Manual Reference Points
- Command syntax details: Page 249
- RDEF format specification: Page 266-267
- Error codes: Page 249 (Error 7 = "An invalid interface command was found")
- Remote control section: Section 10 (starting page 232)

## Next Steps to Try
1. Further investigation of correct READ command format
2. Query additional status information:
   - VPA configuration
   - Channel assignments
   - Range settings
3. Try simpler measurement queries
4. Verify channel configuration and mapping
5. Check if range settings need to be explicitly set
6. Monitor front panel for more detailed error information

## Working Code Structure
```python
def init_m2000():
    # Initialize and configure device
    
def send_command(ser, cmd):
    # Send command and receive response
    
def read_measurements(ser):
    # Attempt to read measurements
    
def main():
    # Main program flow
```

## Open Questions
1. Is there a simpler format for the READ command?
2. Do we need to set ranges explicitly?
3. Is the VPA configuration correct?
4. Are all channels properly mapped?

## Next Testing Session
Plans for next testing session:
1. Verify channel configuration with CHNL? queries
2. Test simpler READ formats
3. Monitor front panel for more detailed feedback
4. Try reading other parameters (frequency, power) to verify command format
5. Check if range settings need adjustment

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or add additional details to the readme?
