AGX Machine Communication Setup - Required Drivers and Configuration

1. Required Drivers
-------------------
   a. USB Drivers:
      - Virtual COM Driver: Enables communication through a virtual serial port (COMx).
      - Network Driver: Enables communication via a virtual IP address, supporting built-in web server functions.

   Installation Process:
      1. Connect the AGX USB port to the PC with a USB cable.
      2. The PC should detect the AGX and automatically install the drivers.
      3. If not installed automatically:
         - Open the “drivers” directory on the detected USB drive.
         - Navigate to the “Windows” subdirectory.
         - Run `Driver_Installer.exe`.

   b. LAN Configuration:
      - The AGX conforms to the LXI (LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation) standard.
      - Obtain an IP address via DHCP or assign a fixed IP address for consistency.

   c. GPIB Drivers:
      - IEEE488.1 standard GPIB driver libraries (e.g., NI-488.2 or equivalent).

2. Communication Setup
-----------------------
   a. USB Connection:
      - Enable USB Virtual COM Port:
        SYSTem:COMMunicate:USB:VIRTualport[:ENABle] 1
      - Check Status:
        SYSTem:COMMunicate:USB:VIRTualport[:ENABle]?

   b. LAN Connection:
      - Enable LAN Interface:
        SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:STATus?
      - Optional: Assign Fixed IP:
        SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:ADDress <IP Address>

   c. GPIB Connection:
      - Enable GPIB Interface:
        SYSTem:COMMunicate:GPIB:ENABle 1
      - Check GPIB Address:
        SYSTem:COMMunicate:GPIB:ADDress?

3. Notes:
   - Ensure the AGX is powered on and connected to the PC before installation.
   - Verify that compatible drivers for USB, LAN, or GPIB are installed.
