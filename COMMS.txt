Here's how to set up the software for LAN, USB, and GPIB communications based on the AGX Series Operation Manual:

### 1. **LAN (Ethernet) Interface Setup**:
- **Access the Interface Setup**:
  Navigate to the `LAN INTERFACE SETUP` screen via the `INTERFACE SETUP` menu.
- **Configuration Options**:
  - **Automatic IP Configuration**: Enable if a DHCP server is available. An IP address will be automatically assigned.
  - **Static IP Configuration**:
    - Set unique IP address for the network.
    - Configure the subnet mask, gateway, and DNS as per the network's settings.
  - **Port Number**: Typically set to 5025 for instrument communication.
- **Caution**:
  Do not connect the LAN port to a Power over Ethernet (PoE) port, as it can damage the LAN interface.

### 2. **USB Interface Setup**:
- **Driver Installation**:
  Install the USB drivers provided in the “Driver_Installer.exe” file under the “Windows” directory. Upon successful installation, two drivers will appear in Device Manager under "Network Adapters" and "Ports (COM & LPT)".
- **Configuration Options**:
  - Enable the virtual serial port for PC control.
  - Use the virtual IP address `192.168.123.1` for the USB-LAN emulation mode.
  - Any changes require a system reboot to take effect.

### 3. **GPIB Interface Setup**:
- **Configuration Steps**:
  - Enable or disable the GPIB interface using the `GPIB INTERFACE SETUP` screen.
  - Set the GPIB address within the range of 1–30 (default is 1).
  - For optimal operation, disable the GPIB interface if not in use to prevent erroneous interrupts.
- **Connection Details**:
  Use an IEEE488.1 standard 24-pin D-Shell Amphenol connector. Ensure no obstruction to other interfaces when connecting.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure access control is appropriately set to avoid unauthorized or hazardous remote operation of the power source.
- For browser-based LAN control, confirm the appropriate IP address and access permissions. Use a supported browser like Chrome or Firefox for full functionality.

These steps should ensure proper communication setup for the AGX Series. Let me know if you need further details on any specific section!
