APS M2000 USB Connection Troubleshooting Guide

Step 1: Physical Connection
--------------------------
1. Ensure the APS M2000 is powered on
2. Check that the USB cable is securely connected to both:
   - The APS M2000 USB port
   - Your computer's USB port
3. Try using a different USB port on your computer
4. Try using a different USB cable if available

Step 2: Driver Installation
--------------------------
1. Download the Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers:
   - Go to: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
   - Click on "Downloads" tab
   - Download the Windows driver
   - Note: Choose the x64 version for 64-bit Windows

2. Install the drivers:
   - Run the downloaded installer
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - Restart your computer after installation

Step 3: Verify Device in Windows
-------------------------------
1. Open Device Manager:
   - Right-click Start button
   - Select "Device Manager"

2. Look for the device:
   - Check under "Ports (COM & LPT)"
   - Look for "Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM#)"
   - If you see it with a yellow warning icon, right-click and select "Update driver"

3. If device not found:
   - Check under "Other devices" for "Unknown device"
   - If found, right-click and select "Update driver"
   - Choose "Browse my computer for drivers"
   - Point to the CP210x drivers you downloaded

Step 4: APS M2000 Settings
-------------------------
1. Check device USB settings:
   - Press the Menu button on the APS M2000
   - Navigate to Communication/Interface settings
   - Ensure USB communication is enabled
   - Note the baud rate setting (default is 9600)

Step 5: Testing Communication
---------------------------
1. After completing the above steps:
   - Run the Python script again: python aps_usb_setup.py
   - The script will list all available COM ports
   - Look for a port with "CP210x" in its description

Common Issues and Solutions
--------------------------
1. "No COM ports found":
   - Verify steps 1-4 above
   - Try unplugging and replugging the USB cable
   - Check Device Manager while plugging/unplugging to see if Windows detects the device

2. "Access denied" error:
   - Ensure no other program is using the COM port
   - Try closing any terminal programs or other software that might be using the port
   - Try running the script with administrator privileges

3. "Device not responding":
   - Verify the baud rate matches the device settings
   - Try power cycling the APS M2000
   - Ensure the device is in remote control mode
